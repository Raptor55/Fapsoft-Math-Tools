# Fapsoft-Math-Tools
Fapsoft Math Tools is a collection of various math-related programs I've made either for fun or derived from excercises.
It is updated very infrequently, but as of October 2015 it includes a P Value calculator (for statistics), a Roman/Arabic numeral converter, a prime number checker, and a matrix determinant calculator. Disclaimer: Fapsoft stands for future application project software.
